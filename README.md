# FizzBuzzApp
This is my first repository. Here i have added a simple project called "FizzBuzzApp". Here user will give a number as an input. If the Number is divided by 3 it will print "Fizz". If the number is divided by 5 it will print "Buzz". If the number is divided by both 
3 and 5 it will print "FizzBuzz"
